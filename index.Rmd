## About Me:

### I am currently pursuing a graduate degree in Data Science at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. Prior to this, I accumulated a decade of experience as an HVAC and plumbing engineer within the engineering consulting industry, before transitioning to the technical field. Since embarking on this career shift, I has acquired proficiency in object-oriented programming and advanced algorithms using Java and C++, as well as demonstrating proficiency in SQL and effectively applying it within the MySQL database system.

#### The other tabs represent work / analyses that I have completed.  Please check them out!
